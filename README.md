## 🚀 About the Project

**Convert** is an improved version of a currency converter that started as a manual project, where exchange rates had to be updated by hand. After revising and refactoring the code, I automated the process by integrating an external API for real-time updates. 

This update was particularly challenging since I only knew the basics of JavaScript before. After two days of intense work, trying and testing different APIs, I finally managed to automate the conversion process. Although it was frustrating at times, especially with many failures, the experience taught me a lot and helped me strengthen my skills in **JavaScript**, **API integration**, and **DOM manipulation**.

Now, users can input an amount, choose a currency, and instantly see the conversion with real-time exchange rates pulled from the API.
